-- |#Instructions For Hilbert# |
-------------------------------

-- Alex: I copied the instructions from the propositions.lean document
-- and deleted the ones that didn't pertain to the Hilbert group

/-
0. Read these instructions carefully.
1. I have tried my best to translate statements of the propositions into Lean.
2. In place of proofs, I have placed sorry's.
3. Do NOT add your proofs to this file. Create a new file called
   euclid_props.lean (and hilbert_props.lean) on CoCalc. Copy the statements there
   and add your proofs to it.
4. You might have to make minor changes to the statement to make it compatible with
   your syntax.  Don't make too many changes though.
5. If you do make a change to the statement, then don't forget to add a note
   in your hilbert_props.lean file.
6. I am also mentioning missing definitions in this file. You need to define these
   in your hilbert.lean / euclid.lean source file so that the propositions given
   here make sense.
7. If you spot some obvious mistakes in the statement of the propositions given
   below then let me know.  You can also ask me for clarifications.
8. This is still an incomplete list and I will keep adding more propositions in
   this file.
